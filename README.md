# Dolla-Dolla Bills: Cache-Friendly Rust

These are the slides from my talk "Dolla Dolla Bills: Cache-Friendly Rust" given at Indy.rs on April 5, 2018.

## Resources

The last few slides contain links to several resources where you can learn more about CPU caches and how to write code that effectively utilizes CPU cache effects. For convenience, here is that list of resources.
